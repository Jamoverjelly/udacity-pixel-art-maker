Steps I need to take to get my Pixel Art page to work:

The user needs to be able to create a grid of cells based on the parameters they select in the grid form:

Grid Height can be selected by its id "inputHeight".
The minimum value this form field will accept is 1
The value attribute is currently set to 1.  This is what is being passed to the JS script.

Your JS script will need to access the form element by its id: "inputHeight" and get its value from the value attribute to update the height of your grid.

Likewise, it will access the form element for Grid Width by id: "inputWidth" and get its value from the corresponding value to make updates to width.

Once it has these variables, it has to build a grid of cells based on these properties


jQuery methods will be important for listening to the events as they take place on the page:

click events in a cell grid will need to trigger functionality that applies the selected color to the clicked on cell

This means the color selected by the user will need to be captured by a function and updates an empty cell with the color.

=========================
Additional functionality
=========================

Add a button to clear the grid when it's clicked (jQuery event listener) which will clear the art work.  You should send a classic JS alert to the user asking them if they're sure they want to clear the canvas

Add a button to remove / re-apply the grid so they can see their artwork with or without a grid background.

You could also add a button to change the cursor to an eraser which you should be able to toggle on or off
