# udacity-pixel-art-maker
Final project in Udacity's Grow with Google scholarship program - develop a simple pixel art web page using JavaScript and DOM manipulation methods.

The Pixel Art Maker project will be completed following Udacity's Pixel Art Project rubric and style guides.

## Objective

Following the HTML and CSS template provided by Udacity, complete the JavaScript programming behind a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.

## Requirements

* User Story: I can view an interactive web page that allows me to specify the size of a grid of "pixels" as a canvas on which to draw.

* User Story: I can choose a color for the pixels I fill in on the interactive canvas.

* User Story: I can click a cell in the canvas grid to fill that cell with my chosen color.

## Notes

In this project, I'll be making use of the skills learned in the JavaScript foundations class as well as jQuery if it becomes apparent while working through the project that setting up event-listeners using jQuery is the best way to detect user interaction activity on the page.

According to the project overview, the tasks involved in developing the interactive pixel canvas will involve:
* Defining variables with `const` and `let`
* Accessing the DOM using methods of the `document` object
* Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners
* Writing nested loops and using loop variables
